# Preview is Now Working!

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Generate Button Issue âœ…
- **Problem**: `pageKind` variable was undefined in handleGeneratePage
- **Fix**: Updated to parse `data.pages` object correctly from API response
- **Result**: Button now triggers generation and displays result

### 2. Missing Form Fields âœ…
- **Problem**: BriefPanel only showed 3 basic fields
- **Fix**: Added complete form with all Brief properties:
  - Business Name *
  - Industry *
  - Target Audience
  - Products/Services (dynamic list with +/- buttons)
  - Key Differentiators (dynamic list)
  - Business Goals (dynamic list)
  - Tone (dropdown)
  - Brand Guidelines Strictness (dropdown)
- **Result**: Full-featured business brief form

### 3. Type Mismatch âœ…
- **Problem**: DraftResponse type didn't match API response structure
- **Fix**: Updated type to include `pages` object
- **Result**: Proper type safety and parsing

3. **View Canvas** (Canvas tab)

4. **Save/Publish/Export**
